The instructions did not work on a PC and I had to use a mac.

Updates I published within app.kontent.ai were not reflecting immediately on the localhost devapp and that was not apparent to me.

Setting up app.kontent.ai seems very use friendly, mostly seems like some small initial dev work and then it can be managed by any marketing person going forward.
I learned more about deploying apps to production, not too familiar with it. Have typically used a 3rd party front end CMS. 

The vue app literally displayed nothing when I used it.
